I chose this dataset from kaggle .This dataset has football player's attributes of the year 2019 given by FIFA.
I made a model to predict a player's Value by given features of the player.
Initially it had 88 columns so I did some feature engineering (data clening) and chose important columns reducing it to 43.
I had no idea about some of the columns like position columns and important skillset columns so I took help from the net and implemented in my way.
I didnot use most of the visualization plots as there were many columns, I did those who were only highly correlated with value column.
Implementing this dataset I faced many problems Stack Overflow helped in a great deal.
Finally I trained my regression model with creating  neural networks and checked with combination of many activation functions and optimizers.
